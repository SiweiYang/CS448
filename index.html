<h3>Course Description and Objectives</h3>

This is a second course on databases that focuses on DBMS internals. It is a project-oriented course that will provide the students, upon successful completion, with an appreciation of the intricacies and complexities of a DBMS and enable them to be able to design and implement the major components of it. The course objective will be achieved by focusing on three fundamental sub-objectives:
<ol>
<li>To understand the fundamentals of storage systems and disk-based data structures;</li>
<li>To understand the process of query processing and optimization; and</li>
<li>To learn the implementation of transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Complementary to the above objectives, the course has a training
component where the students will gain experience, within the context
of a number of assignments, in building components of a DBMS and
incorporating them into an open source system such as MySQL or
PostgreSQL. The lectures may be complemented by guest lectures on
real-life DBMS implementation issues given by colleagues from
industry.  Further details can be found at 
<a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/cDescr/CS448">http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/cDescr/CS448</a>.

<a name="workload"></a>
<h2>Workload and Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The course marking scheme for CS448 is:
<ul>
<li>assignments: 40% (5% A1, 20% A2, 15% A3)</li>
<li>midterm exam: 20%</li>
<li>final exam: 40%</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
In addition, you must pass the exams in order to pass the course.
That is, having a weighted exam average above 50% is a necessary
(but not sufficient) condition for passing.
</p>
<p>
Graduate students enrolled in CS648 have different requirements,
and will use a different marking scheme.
See the <a href="#648info">CS648 section</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
Assignment and exam marks will be posted on
UW's <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/">LEARN on-line course
system</a>.  Log in to <i>LEARN</i> using your WatIAM userId
and password and select CS448/648 to view your marks once they
have been posted.
Mark posting is the <b>only</b> thing we will be using <i>LEARN</i>
for this term.  All course materials can be found on this web
page, and Piazza will be used for discussion and announcements.

<h2>Optional Alternative Workload for CS448 Students</h2>
<p>
CS448 students who wish to participate in
the <a href="http://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de/sigmod2012contest/">SIGMOD
2012 Programming Contest</a> have the option of doing so as a CS448
course project.   CS448 students who choose this alternative will
be evaluated using the CS648 workload and marking scheme, rather than
the standard CS448 scheme.  That is, their programming contest project
will replace CS448 Assignment 3, and they will
use the <a href="#648info">same project, exam and assignment marking
    weights as CS648 students</a>.
Details about the requirements for the SIGMOD programming contest as
a course project can be found on the <a href="648projects.html">CS648 project page</a>.
</p><p>
CS448 students who wish to use this alternative <b>must elect to do so 
no later than January 24th</b>.  This election is not revocable after
January 24th.
</p><p>CS448 students who are interested in this alternative should elect
  to use it by sending e-mail to the instructor by the January 24th
  deadline.   The e-mail should include name, ID number, and UW e-mail
  address.  If you expect to work on the project with a group, please
  also include the names of the other group members.
</p>

<a name="schedule"></a>
<h2>Schedule and Lecture Notes</h2>
<p>
The table below shows planned lecture topics, along with
the corresponding textbook chapters and links to the lecture notes (as
they become available).  The course textbook is <i>Database Management
Systems</i>. R. Ramakrishnan and J. Gehrke. McGraw-Hill. 3rd Edition.
The textbook is optional.  It will be available through the
Davis Centre Library <a href="https://www.reserves.uwaterloo.ca/ares/">course reserves</a>.
</p><p>
Lecture notes are available in PDF format, one slide per page. 
Using Adobe Acrobat or a similar program, you should be able to
print these with multiple slides per page to save paper and cost.
Printing two slides per page, double-sided is a good option - the
slides are still easy to read, even with substantial margins 
(for note taking) left around the slides.

      This table contains data from a web server log.
      The <tt>sql</tt> file defines an index on the <tt>request</tt>
      field, which contains the actual text of an http request handled
      by the web server.  The <tt>request</tt> field contains

     The data in this table give the frequency of different baby names
     in New York City from 1920 to the present.   For each year, it
     identifies the names given to babies and number of times each
     name was given in that year.   There are duplicates in the name
     field (because most names are repeated once for each year), but
     the values are shorter than those in the <tt>httplog</tt> data.
     (Note that you will find the names <tt>FEMALE</tt>
     and <tt>MALE</tt> in the <tt>name</tt> column of this table.
     These values were used to represent those babies that were not

<h2>CS648 Information</h2>

Students enrolled in CS648 are responsible only for the first two
assignments (A1 and A2).  Instead of A3, CS648 students must do a
final project.

Information about the CS648 final project is available on the
<a href="648projects.html">CS648 project information page</a>.

CS648 will use the following marking scheme, which differs from the
CS448 marking scheme because of the project:
<ul>
  <li>assignments: 20% (4% A1, 16% A2 )</li>
  <li>midterm exam: 10%</li>
  <li>final exam: 40%</li>
  <li>course project: 30%</li>
</ul>
Like CS448 students, CS648 students must pass the exams to pass the
course.  That is, having a weighted exam average above 50% is a necessary
(but not sufficient) condition for passing.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>
In order to maintain a culture of academic
integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are
expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and
responsibility. All members of the UW community are expected to hold
to the highest standard of academic integrity in their studies,
teaching, and research. The Office of Academic Integrity's website
<a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity">
(www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity)</a>
contains detailed information on
UW policy for students and faculty. This site explains why academic
integrity is important and how students can avoid academic
misconduct. It also identifies resources available on campus for
students and faculty to help achieve academic integrity in - and out -
of the classroom.
<p>
<b>Grievance</b>: A student who believes that a decision affecting some
aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may
have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70 - Student
Petitions and Grievances, Section 4,

<a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm</a>
<p>
<b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take
responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an
action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to
avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for
group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course
professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. When
misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties
will be imposed under Policy 71 - Student Discipline. For information
on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should
refer to Policy 71 - Student Discipline,
<a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm</a>
<p>

<b>Avoiding Academic Offenses:</b> Most students are unaware of the line
between acceptable and unacceptable academic behaviour, especially
when discussing assignments with classmates and using the work of
other students.  For information on commonly misunderstood academic
offenses and how to avoid them, students should refer to the Faculty
of Mathematics Cheating and Student Academic Discipline Policy,
<a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/Current/cheating_policy.shtml">
http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/Current/cheating_policy.shtml</a>

<p>
<b>Appeals:</b> A student may appeal the finding and/or penalty in a decision
made under Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances (other than
regarding a petition) or Policy 71 - Student Discipline if a ground
for an appeal can be established. Read Policy 72 - Student Appeals,
<a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">
