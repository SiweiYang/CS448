<h1>CS 648 Project Information - Winter 2012</h1>

<h2>Project Types</h2>
<p>
Three types of projects are acceptable for this course:

<h3>1. Participate in the <a href="http://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de/sigmod2012contest/">SIGMOD 2012 Programming
    Contest</a></h3>
<p>
The annual <a href="http://www.sigmod.org/2012/">ACM SIGMOD
Conference</a> is one of the major research conferences
in the general area of data management.  The 2012 SIGMOD
Conference will take place in Scottsdale, Arizona in late May.
There is a student programming contest associated with the
conference.   Five finalists will be invited to the conference
to present their work, and the winning team will receive 
a $5000 USD prize.   
<p>
CS648 students may participate in the SIGMOD 2012 Programming Contest
as their course project.   The deliverables for this project are:
<ul>
<li>Your contest implementation, which must be submitted to the
 contest organizers by the contest's stated deadline (currently, March
 21st).
 A copy of your implementation must also be submitted to the instructor.</li>
<li>A written project report (8 pages maximum).  Your report should describe 
the design of your index structure and your design rationale.  It
  should also present the results of any performance evaluation that you have
  performed on your implementation.   The report is due on <b>April
    2nd</b>.</li>
<li>A group contribution report (1 page maximum, only for group
  projects).   This report should describe the contribution of 
each member of the group to the project.  The group contribution
  report is due on <b>April 2nd</b>, along with the written project
  report.</li> 
</ul>
The SIGMOD Programming Contest project can be done individually or
in groups of up to 4 students.
</p><p>
Contest projects will be graded using the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Design (50%), as determined by contest performance and/or the
  results
of your own performance evaluation, and by the design description and rationale in the project report.</li>
<li>Report Presentation (25%): clarity, organization, grammar.</li>
<li>Evaluation (25%), as determined by the thoughfulness and informativeness
of your performance evaluation, and its presentation in the project report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Implementation Project</h3>
<p>
Design, implement, and document a useful and novel feature
in PostgreSQL or another DBMS.
The subject of the project is up to you.
For example:
<ul>
<li>Design an improved tool for visualizing PostgreSQL query
evaluation plans.</li>
<li>Design a tool for displaying information about the PostgreSQL
query optimization process, including, e.g., information about
plans that are rejected by the optimizer.</li>
<li>Design a mechanism for auto-tuning a server configuration
parameter (e.g., <tt>shared_buffers</tt>) or for predicting the
performance impact of change in parameter value.</li>
</ul>
<!--
Some possible features might be
a mechanism for dynamically resizing PostgreSQL's  buffer cache,
an implementation of a new database access method, or a
mechanism for generating
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast05/tech/li_x.html"
target="_top">I/O hints</a> from PostgreSQL. 
However, these are just examples.
You decide what you'd like to implement - pick something
that you're interested in.
-->
<p>
The deliverables for an implementation project are:
<ul>
<li>A written project report (8 pages maximum).
This report should include a description of the feature that
you implemented, a discussion of your design, and a brief
survey of any related work (e.g., research papers or similar
features in other DBMS).
</li>
<li>A copy of your software, including any testing code.</li>
<li>For group projects, a group contribution report (1 page maximum).
This report should describe the contribution of 
each member of the group to the project. 
</ul>
Implementation projects may be done individually or in groups
of two.  They are due on <b>April 2nd</b>.
</p><p>
Implementation projects will be graded using the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Design and Implementation (50%), as determined by the design description and
  rationale in the project report, and your success in implementing
  the design.</li>
<li>Report Presentation (25%): clarity, organization, grammar.</li>
<li>Survey (25%), as determined by the presentation related work in
  the project report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Survey Paper</h3>
<p>
Write a research survey paper on a relevant topic.
Surveys should be
comprehensive, well organized, and self-contained.
Although your source papers will probably use different
terminology and notation, your survey must be internally
consistent throughout.
A survey that is constructed by simply gluing together a 
sequence of short summaries of others' papers is not acceptable.
Instead, your survey should provide
significant added value above and beyond the source material,
through interpretation, organization and explanation.
</p><p>
If you are not sure what a survey paper should be like, you should
review existing surveys before embarking on your project.
A good source of survey papers is the journal
<i>ACM Computing Surveys</i>, the contents of which you can
obtain on-line through the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm">ACM
  Digital Library</a>.  
For example, you might review the following relevant (though 
somewhat dated) survey:<br><br>
Graefe, Goetz.<br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/152610.152611">Query evaluation techniques for large databases.</a><br>
<i>ACM Computing Surveys</i>, 25(2), June 1993.<br><br>
The contents of the ACM Digital Library are access-controlled, but you
should be able to access the Library freely from any machine on
the UW network.
</p><p>
Notice how the survey reads as a self-contained, coherent,
organized overview of the topic,
with appropriate references to the surveyed literature.
By reading such an article one can (a) come up to speed on a topic (b)
obtain references to the literature in case it is desirable to dig
deeper.
The scope of your survey must be more limited than this example's,
because your survey will be shorter.   However, I expect the
same type of presentation.
</p><p>
Write in your own words and use proper attribution where
necessary.  Do not plagiarize your sources!
Please
review <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">Waterloo's
academic integrity policies and guidelines</a>, and follow them.
If you have questions, contact the instructor.
</p><p>
The only deliverable for a survey project is the survey paper
itself.  The maximum length of the survey paper is 15 pages.
The paper is due on <b>April 2nd</b>.
</p><p>
Survey papers must be done individually.
<p>
Survey papers will be evaluated using the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Presentation Quality (25%): clarity, organization, grammar.
<li>Breadth of Coverage (25%)</li>
<li>Depth and Value-Added (50%)</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Project Schedule</h2>

<dl>
<dt>10 February:</dt><dd>Project proposals (2 pages max) due.</dd>
<dt>2 April:</dt><dd>Project deliverables due (except SIGMOD contest
    submissions, which are due earlier).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
<p>
Your project proposal should describe the project you intend to do.
For a survey, you should briefly describe the topic of your proposed 
survey.  You should also include a brief (2-5 entries is fine)
preliminary bibliography to show you have taken the initial steps to
identify major papers in the area you propose to survey.
For an implementation project, you should briefly describe what
you propose to implement.  For a group project, be sure to identify
both members of your group.
For the SIGMOD programming contest, your proposal need only indicate
that you intend to participate in the contest and identify the members
of your group (this can just be done in an e-mail message - no PDF
required.)
</p><p>
Proposals should be submitted by e-mail to the course instructor.
For group projects, only one member of the group should submit.

<h2>Project Reports and Survey Papers</h2>
<p>
Submit all project reports/papers in PDF format.  Use the two-column ACM
proceedings format for your report.
